https://github.com/jiaaro/pydub/blob/master/pydub/silence.py#L6

    You might find the pydub.silence.detect_silence() function useful. It returns a list of ranges where silence was detected (itâ€™s used inside the split on silence function)

    there is also pydub.silence.detect_nonsilent() in case that is more helpful

from pydub import AudioSegment
from pydub.silence import split_on_silence

    sound_file = AudioSegment.from_wav("a-z.wav")
    audio_chunks = split_on_silence(sound_file, 
        # must be silent for at least half a second
        min_silence_len=500,

        # consider it silent if quieter than -16 dBFS
        silence_thresh=-16
    )

    for i, chunk in enumerate(audio_chunks):

        out_file = ".//splitAudio//chunk{0}.wav".format(i)
        print "exporting", out_file
        chunk.export(out_file, format="wav")
