Thanks, Peter; I tried that, but couldn't get it to work either. 

I think I have solved the problem though (I still need to try and 
reproduce it from scratch, to verify my theory). It seems that 
Powershell uses UCS-2 character encoding when using redirectors (the 
">" in my commands). Changing the file encoding to ANSI or UTF-8 
allows the private key to be imported properly. It is unclear to me 
why the public key would import fine, however. 

For the record, I was using redirectors instead of the "-o" option 
because apparently it has no effect (at least in Powershell on 
Windows) if you use it after the --export option. I have now figured 
out that I can use "-ao <file.asc>" before the "--export-secret-key 
<key_id>" and everything works fine: 

> gpg -ao private.asc --export-secret-key <key_id> 
> gpg --import private.asc 
gpg: key <key_id>: already in secret keyring 
gpg: Total number processed: 1 
gpg: secret keys read: 1 
gpg: secret keys unchanged: 1 

Thanks for the help!
