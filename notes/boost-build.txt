    Chapter 2. Installation

    To install Boost.Build from an official release or a nightly build, as available on the official web site, follow these steps: 

    1. Unpack the release. On the command line, go to the root of the unpacked tree. 
    2. Run either .\bootstrap.bat (on Windows), or ./bootstrap.sh (on other operating systems). 
    3. Run ./b2 install --prefix=PREFIX
    where PREFIX is a directory where you want Boost.Build to be installed. 
    4. Optionally, add PREFIX/bin to your PATH environment variable. 

    If you are not using a Boost.Build package, but rather the version bundled with the Boost C++ Libraries, the above commands should be run in the tools/build/v2 directory.

    Now that Boost.Build is installed, you can try some of the examples. Copy PREFIX/share/boost-build/examples/hello to a different directory, then change to that directory and run: 
    PREFIX/bin/b2

    A simple executable should be built. 


b2 define=NOENC
