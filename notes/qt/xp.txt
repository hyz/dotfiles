### http://wiki.qt.io/Qt_5_on_Windows_ANGLE_and_OpenGL#Recommendations
    Use Desktop OpenGL if 
        Your application uses OpenGL calls not part of OpenGL ES 2.0
        Your application does not use OpenGL at all (since ANGLE implies additional deployment dependencies which are then not needed).
        Your application needs to run on Windows XP. Although it is tempting to use ANGLE as a replacement for missing graphics drivers on this platform, it does not fully work and may lead to crashes, for example, when the security dialog is opened.

### The procedure entry point Direct3DCreate9Ex could not be located in the dynamic link library d3d9.dll

        As far as I know Qt 5.6 does not support Windows XP any more, so no it is not a bug.
        If you really need to support XP then you can still use Qt 5.5.1
