This is what I have got working for me, after much help on this forum. Thanks.
I did a fresh install for this and so far it seems to be working. ¡°User¡± is the Account name created at install.
Enable built in admin account, open cmd.exe (run as admin) and type -

1.      net user administrator /active:yes
2.      shutdown /r /f /t 00
 After restart, login to Administrator and open CMD, Run as Admin, enter the following ¨C
3.      robocopy /copyall /mir /xj "C:\Users\Public" "D:\Users\Public"
4.      robocopy /copyall /mir /xj "C:\Users\wood" "D:\Users\wood"
5.      rmdir /S /Q "C:\Users\Public"
6.      rmdir /S /Q "C:\Users\wood"
7.      mklink /J "C:\Users\Public" "D:\Users\Public"
8.      mklink /J "C:\Users\wood" "D:\Users\wood"
9.      shutdown /r /f /t 00
After restart, login back in to administrator
10.   Under HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\ProfileList
a.      Find a key similar to this, "S-1-5-21-4288074848-3222386265-3783365272-1000", that has your User name and change the C to D.
Disable built in admin account, open cmd.exe (run as admin) and type -
11.   net user administrator /active:no
12.   shutdown /r /f /t 00
After restart, login to your account.

I actually created 3 cmd files, 1st with steps 1-2, the 2nd with steps 3-9, 3rd with steps 11-12.( Put Pause in between -each step)
Once again, thanks for the help!

*If not a fresh install, after step 2's restart press F8 to perform steps 3-9 in safe mode.
