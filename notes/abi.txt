    From ARM docs,
        PCS Procedure Call Standard.
        AAPCS Procedure Call Standard for the ARM Architecture (this standard). (current standard )
        APCS ARM Procedure Call Standard (obsolete).
    Also, from the same doc,
        The AAPCS embodies the fifth major revision of the APCS and third major revision of the TPCS. It forms part of the complete ABI specification for the ARM Architecture.
    So you can forget about the obsoleted APCS and start following AAPCS
