# Add auto-completion and a stored history file of commands to your Python
# interactive interpreter. Requires Python 2.0+, readline. Autocomplete is
# bound to the Esc key by default (you can change it - see readline docs).
#
# Store the file in ~/.pystartup, and set an environment variable to point
# to it:  "export PYTHONSTARTUP=/home/gsf/.pystartup" in bash.
#
# Note that PYTHONSTARTUP does *not* expand "~", so you have to put in the
# full path to your home directory.

# import os
# import readline
# import rlcompleter
# import sys
# 
# # change autocomplete to tab
# readline.parse_and_bind("tab: complete")
# readline.set_history_length(10000)
# 
# hisfile = os.path.expanduser("~/.python_history")

# def save_history(hisfile=hisfile):
#     import readline
#     readline.write_history_file(hisfile)
# 
# if os.path.exists(hisfile):
#     readline.read_history_file(hisfile)
# 
# atexit.register(save_history)
# 
# # anything not deleted (sys and os) will remain in the interpreter session
# del atexit, readline, rlcompleter, save_history, hisfile
